假装工作

**Pretend to be busy or waiting for your computer when you should actually be doing real work!** Impress people with your insane multitasking skills. Just open a few instances of `genact` and watch the show. `genact` has multiple scenes that pretend to be doing something exciting or useful when in reality nothing is happening at all.
